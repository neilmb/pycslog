# Pycslog, a Python Client-Serve Logger

Pycslog is a ham radio contest logger using a client-server model.

The user interacts with a client front-end that communicates with
a server that knows about the current contest and the contacts
already in the log to provide dupe information, suggested exchanges,
possible calls, etc.
